- [x] Fix TUI
    - Drawing the background does not work and acts weird with changing foreground (tested with an extension.)
- [ ] Implement actual editor logic because OBVIOUSLY an **edit**or needs to **EDIT.**
- [ ] Expose public functions to the API.
- [ ] At some point add Windows support.
- [ ] Support all key and mouse inputs.
- [ ] Separate editor logic from `src/main.c` and modularize `src/ui.c` into multiple files like `src/ui_color.c` and `src/ui_buf.c`.
